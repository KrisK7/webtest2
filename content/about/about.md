### What is Uisge Beatha?

The phrase Uisge Beatha is the origin of the word whisky and means the water of life. Aqua vitae is an archaic name for a concentrated aqueous solution of ethanol widely used during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the Scots Gaelic equivelent of this phrase is Uisge Beatha, the Irish version is Uisce Beatha. As with every aspect of the Scots vs. Irish debate which one came first is hotly contested.
