The Auchentoshan 21 Years is a complex, yet mild Scotch whisky. Its fresh, floral fragrance leaves you wanting more, and in the taste of the Auchentoshan delivers what it promises. The Auchentoshan 21 Years is of course three times distilled, and was over 20 years aged in American bourbon barrels and Spanish sherry casks. The long storage time in different barrels have made a kompklexen yet mild Auchentoshan arise.
