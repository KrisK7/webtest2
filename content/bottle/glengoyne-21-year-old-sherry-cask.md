description: "For twenty-one years, the Glengoyne 21 Years matures in First Fill sherry casks from European oak. In it It develops a deep and complex taste that lives entirely on the oak wood note and the expressive sherry aromas. Glengoyne has made a real coup with this single Highland Malt. If you let your nose float over the edge of the glass, you will hear a smell of red apples, vanilla pods, honey, pastries and fresh hay. On the tongue, the oak wood aroma then smacks like a bomb, sending waves after wave of warm spiciness across all taste buds. When the smoke clears, the charming scotch leaves with a ginger-colored adíos that makes you grateful for the beautiful finish in Spanish wood.90 / 100 points. Jim Murray’s Whiskey Bible 2010.
