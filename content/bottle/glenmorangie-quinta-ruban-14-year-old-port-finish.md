The Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 14 years is produced in the Scottish distillery Glenmorangie, which is renowned for its quality whiskey. Already in the early 18th century whiskey was distilled here. The suffix '' Quinta '' refers to the Portuguese wine barrels in which the whiskey matures. The Gaelic word '' Ruban '' stands for Rubin and describes the color of Glenmorangie, which is actually ruby ​​red with a brownish tinge. When serving the Glenmorangie exudes a complex aroma that consists of mint, chocolate and tangerines. The taste is initially spicy, then chocolaty-nutty. The whole is pervaded by a subtle hint of mint and lemon. A total refreshing, spicy yet smooth whiskey, which also ensures a long, pleasant finish. It should enjoy pure necessarily alternatively with some ice.
