The Loch Lomond Single Grain is a real feature and comes from the distillery Loch Lomond in Alexandria in the Highlands. Unlike a single malt of Loch Lomond Single Grain from malted barley in a Coffey-style complex is distilled. By storage in barrels of American white oak arise aromas of creamy vanilla and fresh fruit. The Loch Lomond Single Graun whiskey bears no indication of age, but surprises with its rich notes of tropical fruit, vanilla and a hint of smoke.
