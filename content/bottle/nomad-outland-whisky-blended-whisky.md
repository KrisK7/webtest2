The Nomad blended Scotch whiskey with P.X. Finish is a whiskey of the company Gonzalez, which has its headquarters in Jerez de la Frontera, so in Spain. Whiskey, like so many of his high-quality colleagues in Schottland.Der blended Scotch whiskey is matured in sherry casks, where it probably has its bright, shiny amber color was produced. A blend whiskey is called a mixture or blend, combines different whiskeys which in itself. To connect the whiskey taste each other, the final product is aged again in barrels. Thus, the harmonious flavor can spread and completely develop the character. A very good wine that's too bad for mixed drinks actually.
