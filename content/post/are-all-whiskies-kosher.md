Not all [whiskies are considered kosher](https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/is-whisky-kosher/). In order for a whisky to be considered kosher, it must be produced and bottled under the supervision of a rabbi in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. This means that the ingredients, production process, and equipment used to make the whisky must all be in compliance with these laws. In addition, the whisky must be free of any non-kosher additives or ingredients. There are many whiskies that are not produced in this way, so not all whiskies are considered kosher.

In 2015 The Israeli Chief Rabbinate – the spiritual authority for Jews in Israel – claims certain imports of Johnnie Walker falsely carry a kosher classification and are therefore unsuitable for a kosher diet.
