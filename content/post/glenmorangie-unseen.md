## Discover the Glenmorangie Vault

The starring attraction of the Unseen pop-up will without fail be the Glenmorangie Vault showcasing some of the brands rarest offerings including the impossible rare 1963, the press release promises

### The Glenmorangie 1963

The Glenmorangie 1963 is a 23 year old offering which currently retails at £1,500 per bottle, not surprising given its age and that only 6,000 bottles were ever made. In fact the last were thought to be long gone until workers at Glenmorangie stumbled upon 50 bottles which had never left the factory, these were rebottled in 2013, of the 50 discovered only two remain in the UK. Oak matured for 22 years before being transferred to Spanish Oloroso sherry casks for a further year, it's described thus:
"Glenmorangie 1963 is a warm walnut brown in colour and on nosing offers a beguiling mix of toasted coconut, vanilla fudge and cherries. Glenmorangie 1963 offers notes of juicy peaches, pineapples and sweet caramelised oranges, dusted with Demerara sugar. Notes of nutmeg, marzipan and walnuts are also prevalent; characteristic of Oloroso Sherry cask finishing".

### The Glenmorangie 1970s Collection

The Glenmorangie collection is a limited release (only ten sets were made) showcasing Scottish whisky creation during the 1970s. Featuring a bottle of the 1971, 1975, 1975 Tain l’Hermitage, 1976 and 1977 expressions shown below in a bespoke handmade case designed by Dutch designer Wouter Scheublin

### Glenmorangie Pride 1978

Following on from the success of the Glenmorangie Pride 1981 came the Glenmorangie Pride 1978 one of only 700 bottles ever released. This 34 year old offering crafted by Dr Bill Lumsden the Head of Distilling & Whisky Creation at Glenmorangie was cask matured for 19 years before being double barel matured in French Premier Grand Cru claret casks for a further 15.

Lumsden describes the creation as “a luxurious burnished copper with rich, decadent and delicious scents of chestnut, toffee and cherries" Describing it as his "most exquisite expression yet, one that will be savoured by whisky enthusiasts across the globe”.

## By The Dram

The prospect of sampling the 1963 and 1978 by the dram is certain to bring out deep pocketed whisky conosiers so these wont last long, as will the chance to take home the 1970s collection. Even if these are a little rich for you blood Glenmorangie unseen will also offer the brands full range expressions available by the dram. For those unable to make it I'll be reporting back in a future post but you can find out more about the brand in their new quarterly publication ["Unseen"](https://glenmorangie.com/en/unseen)
