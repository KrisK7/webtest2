description: "While it comes as no surprise to most consumers in Europe elsewhere the term Scotch is more commonly associated with a style, whisky made using malted barley, rather than with its country of origin. This has led some brands struggling to define and differentiate their offering to the market as Pure Malt Whiskey and on one poetic case Whiskey Del Bac"

It might sound obvious but Scotch whisky must come from Scotland. In the same way that a bourbon must by law come from American (not only Kentucky). Scotch is a legally protected term covered under theÂ Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 which requires that a Scotch be:
<ol>
	<li>Produced in Scottish distillery using water &amp; Malted barley</li>
	<li>Mashed at that distillery</li>
	<li>Fermented &amp; brewed only using yeast</li>
	<li>Distilled to no more than 94.8% (190 US proof)</li>
	<li>Matured in Scotland for a minimum of three years in barrels no more than 700 litres</li>
	<li>Containing no added substances, other than water and plain (E150A) caramel colouring</li>
	<li>Bottled at a minimum ABV of 40% (80 US proof)</li>
</ol>
This causes certain obvious issues of confusion for other countries such as America where Scotch is more typically associated with a style of whisky by the average consumer as Charles Passy explains in the below video.
