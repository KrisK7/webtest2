The Kavalan Solist Vinho Barriquewas took the title of world’s best single malt beating competition from Scotland, Japan, Ireland, France, Sweden, South Africa, Australia and the US.

The highly coveted top award the World's Best Single Malt Whisky had changed hands between Scotland and Japan since the awards inception in 2007 until last year when Australia's Sullivans Cove French Oak Cask took the title. Previous Winners were:

The 2014 champion from the island state of Tasmania marked the first transition away from the traditional Scottish and Japanese heartlands and many had viewed this as a fluke but the craft of whisky creation has truly gone global with the new Champion coming from Taiwan.
<h2>World's Best Single Malt Whisky</h2>
The <span itemprop="description">Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique expression produced by Taiwanese King Car distillery has taken the prestigious title of world's best single malt whisky. The distilleries limited run, cask strength offerings are labelled Solist, these are young, high strength whiskies with bold and complex flavours make the case for adding water, in this instance the expression clocks in at 59.2% ABV. Using re-toasted red and white wine casks the whisky expression is described as being bold, with a berry plum and notes of caramel. </span>
<span itemprop="description">My sample is in the post so I'll put up a review as soon as possible though coming in at a whopping this is a whisky that makes the case for adding water.
