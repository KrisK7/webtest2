Thanks to a patented method, which can extract &amp;ldquo;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Cut&amp;rdquo; from the barrels and combine with a minimum of six-year-old Jim Beam.

This relatively small amount, the &amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; Devil&amp;rsquo;s share &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;, is married with six year old Jim Beam whiskey and produces a particularly rich, intense whiskey with an equally strong coloration. The bouquet is smoky oak flavors and delicate vanilla unfold. On the palate, the new creation convinces with an intense vanilla and cinnamon note, wood and caramel. The finish is long and intense.
