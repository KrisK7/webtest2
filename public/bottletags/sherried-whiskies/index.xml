      <description>&lt;p&gt;For twenty-one years, the Glengoyne 21 Years matures in First Fill sherry casks from European oak. In it It develops a deep and complex taste that lives entirely on the oak wood note and the expressive sherry aromas. Glengoyne has made a real coup with this single Highland Malt. If you let your nose float over the edge of the glass, you will hear a smell of red apples, vanilla pods, honey, pastries and fresh hay. On the tongue, the oak wood aroma then smacks like a bomb, sending waves after wave of warm spiciness across all taste buds. When the smoke clears, the charming scotch leaves with a ginger-colored adíos that makes you grateful for the beautiful finish in Spanish wood.90 / 100 points. Jim Murray’s Whiskey Bible 2010. The Glengoyne 21 Years is in the truest sense of the word a golden boy. The Single Highland Malt has received the highest honors from international critics and been awarded gold medals for its exquisite taste. Glengoyne 21 Year Old Sherry Cask is a 21 year old single malt whisky from the Glengoyne whisky distillery (located in the Highland region).
