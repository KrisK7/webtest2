      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nikka Whiskey from the barrels can not be sufficiently recommended. If only his appearance stands out from the other whiskies, so It comes in a distinctive 0.5l square bottle. Mature malt whiskey and grain whiskey are mixed and then re-casked. Nikka from the barrel has at cask strength over an alcohol content of 51.4% vol., And has a distinctive personality, due to its rich flavors and deep flavor. It need not fear comparison with the Scottish blends. From the land of the rising sun a whiskey as one would never expect him to Japan comes. While the UK and especially Scotland regarded as the home of whiskey, here comes from Japan a very good blend of Nikka From The Barrel. It comes from the distillery Nikka; the second largest in Japan. The distillation takes place in Coffrey-Still process and then this whiskey can mature until it is bottled. This time it spends in bourbon casks and barrels of sherry, which gives it a special touch. In 2007 and 2010, the Nikka From The Barrel received high honors in the class &amp;ldquo;Blend Blended Whiskey Japanese&amp;rdquo;, and has been even more popular. This whiskey is considered extremely powerful and already in the glass has a beautiful, slightly reddish brown color. The aroma is supported by fruity and spicy notes, which are complemented with floral nuances. Peat and wood are added and give the drink a classic touch. Also oak and spices you and the sweetness of honey tastes before vanilla is noticeable in the finish and lasts long. On the Rocks or pure, it is a real treat, even if one does not enjoy in Asia but in Europe. More information about the product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
