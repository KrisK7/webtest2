            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Canadian whisky sometimes suffers from a whirlwind of contrary media, some going so far as to call it brown vodka, some calling it the best whisky in the world and others highlighting the 9.09% rule.</p>
<ol>
<li>Points of interest on Canadian whisky:
The terms &ldquo;Canadian Whisky&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rye Whisky&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Canadian Rye Whisky&rdquo; are legally indistinguishable in Canada and do not require any specific grain in their production and are often blends of two or more grains</li>
<li>Jim Murray did award Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye “World Whisky of the Year 2016”
Canadian whisky can indeed contain 9.09% non-whisky alcohol</li>
<li>They don’t export too much of it outwith the Americas (until very recently Canadian whisky was the most popular whisky in America)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="canadas-world-whisky-of-the-year-award">Canada’s World Whisky of the Year Award</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Jim Murray and his award (One man’s opinion). Yes it won the award (again one man’s often questionable/bias opinion). Apart from talking a lot of guff on a variety of topics being controversial is how he gets headlines, which is how he makes money by selling books, running tastings etc. Put simply if Jim Murray consistently awarded Scottish whiskies this award would anyone really care outwith the usual whisky pundits. None of which is to say that he’s wrong (though i certainly know no-one who shares this opinion) - this kind of headline does bother me though (If i’m being honest this fills me with a barely contained fury that suggests I may have deeper issues for which I may need counselling).</p>
<p>Telling people that what is at best a solid whisky (a no-frills supermarket bottle) is a great way of disappointing lots of people. As a first time drinker if I drank Crown Royal Rye I would run screaming back to Jack Daniels and coke never to be seen again. These headline grabbing announcements are reckless as they run the risk of putting people off whisky. The one saving grace is that, at least in the UK, hes chosen a hard to get bottle. This inaccessibility meaning few will be especially disappointed.</p>
<h2 id="canadian-whisky-requirements">Canadian Whisky Requirements</h2>
<p>Although I can find no verifiable explanation of how this came into effect it is possible for Canadian whisky makers to add up to 9.09% (one part in eleven) non-whisky spirit to their bottles and still call this whisky. Although this at first glance seems like sacrilege it’s worth noting that this is not especially common, the term non-whisky spirit is somewhat confusing and there are financial reasons for this deviation from the norm.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-non-whisky-spirit">What is non-whisky spirit</h3>
<p>Non-whisky spirit is any alcohol not made using grain matured for three years in wooden barrels. In reality this is often simply imported whisky because unlike American blends which can actually contain neutral alcohol, Canadian legislation has 2 specific criteria which must be met:
The spirit must posses “the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky”
The spirit in the bottle be aged to a minimum of three years (this doesn’t impact the bottles age statement). The result is that Canadian blenders can use imported spirits and still call their product “Canadian Whisky”. A perfect example is Alberta Dark Batch Rye which contains not only 8% imported American bourbon but also a further 1% oloroso sherry.</p>
<p>In this instance the inclusion of a small amount of sherry, bearing in mind sherry casks are often used to finish Whisky, would not fundamentally change the spirits flavour. At least so it is argued</p>
<h3 id="tax-benefits">Tax benefits</h3>
<p>The motivation for the inclusion of non-whisky spirit is simple tax, as a way to support American producers, US tax law provides incentives for foreign spirits that include some American-made spirits. The consequence is that this is more prevalent in the cheaper bottom shelf supermarket spirits made at scale and not for the more premium</p>
<p>If you are open to moving into the land of rumours there’s an <a href="http://whiskyadvocate.com/2015/06/15/the-curious-canadian-case-of-the-9-09-rule/">interesting article</a> over on whisky advocate that discusses the origin of this bizarre law.</p>
<h2 id="american-demand">American Demand</h2>
<p>There’s a common misconception that prohibition was a boost for Canadian Whisky as thirsty Americans looked North. Actually the history books tell it differently, American prohibition decimated not only the American industry but a lot of others around the world, <a href="http://uiscebeatha.co.uk/the-downfall-of-irish-whiskey/">none more so than Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Canadian whisky was the dominant spirit in the Americas by 1865, in large part due to the Civil war, three three generations before Prohibition. This remained the case up until 2010, when for the first time, bourbon outsold Canadian whisky in the United States. Even so Canadian whisky is still the best selling whisky in North America.</p>
