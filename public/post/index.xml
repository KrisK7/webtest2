      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-angels-share&#34;&gt;What Is The Angels Share?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Angels Share is alcohol lost due to evaporation during the maturation of whisky. The exact amount lost to evaporation varies based on the properties of the wood, the skill of the cooper, the humidity of the region and how regularly the casks are turned. The term is also the name of a Scottish comedy drama directed by Ken Loach centered around a fictional cask of Islay’s Malt Mill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The difference of flavour between Malt and Blend whiskies can &lt;em&gt;largely&lt;/em&gt; be traced to three factors, the grain used, the way it&amp;rsquo;s distilled, and the way the alcohol is matured.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Annandale distillery re-opened in 2007 has become the first Scotch to put its first cask up for sale, for the eye-watering price of £1 million. In a stroke of marketing genius that will certainly make the world take notice. The restored and refurbished whisky distillery and visitor centre sees the water of life return to Dumfries-shire a long term dream of Professor David Thompson 59 his wife Teresa Church 55. Production began in 2014 and the first fill is expected to be matured for at least 10 years, though it could legally be opened in 2018 after maturing for its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uiscebeatha.co.uk/bourbon-vs-whisky/&#34;&gt;minimum of 3 years&lt;/a&gt; and still be considered a Scotch&lt;/p&gt;</description>
