Unfortunately, though perhaps unsurprisingly no that Lidl/Aldi/insert £30 supermarket whisky isn't the best in the world.
<p>These articles are at best misleading, and at worst downright dishonest. In each case the issue with the article is a combination of the competency and integrity of the journalist, their need to generate ad revenue, and the deliberately confusing world of whisky awards. There are a few issues to unpick:</p>
<h2>There is no best whisky award</h2>
Whisky is an incredibly diverse product produced around the globe. While some awards/one man opinion awards (such as Jim Murray's Whisky Bible) <strong><em>may</em></strong> award a best in category there is no individual, or award panel arguing that that one category wins out over another. Is the <a href="https://uisgebeatha.co.uk/category/bourbon-whiskies/">best bourbon</a> really better than that<a href="https://uisgebeatha.co.uk/category/single-malt-whiskies/"> single malt</a>? Can you really compare that rye whisky to that grain?
<p>We may have a personal preference but if there&rsquo;s no best category then there cannot be a &lsquo;best whisky in the word&rsquo;. If we&rsquo;re talking personal preference then I&rsquo;d give a shout out to the 37 year old Brora, my personal gold standard, though it costs a wee bit more than £30.</p>
<h2>Awards are often price based</h2>
This makes perfect sense if you think it through. Can a 6 year old single malt whisky really be compared to a 30 year old single cask? Some awards factor price into an overall score meaning cheaper whiskies earn more points, others separate the whisky into bands.
<p>Either way the award in question almost certainly isn&rsquo;t putting a supermarket single malt against the heavyweights in a distilleries core range, nevermind against the lost gems of closed distilleries.</p>
<h2>There are often multiple gold awards per category</h2>
While some whisky awards have a best in category a surprising number of these are in fact point based.
<p>Under the points system any whisky scoring above a certain threshold will automatically be given a gold or silver award. It&rsquo;s not unusual for there to be dozens of gold winners per category. This happens for a very simple reason :</p>
<h3>Awards are generally pay to pay</h3>
If inclusion into an award category requires a brand to pay them the brand included are expecting to get something out of it.
<p>Ignoring the fact that the only whiskies being compared are from brands and distilleries willing to pay (and supply bottles for sampling) very few would participate if they had only a 1 in 500 shot of an award.</p>
<h2>Should you pay attention to whisky awards?</h2>
Despite a lot of noise and numerous problems yes whisky awards are often a great way to discover new whiskies. There are more legitimate awards such as the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9129738/type/dlg/https://www.magazine.co.uk/magazines/whisky-magazine">annual whisky magazine</a> awards, and even one man opinion awards can introduce you to world whiskies that are limited in supply, or new expressions ahead of the curve.
<h2>Should I buy supermarket whiskies</h2>
Supermarkets such as Lidl &amp; Aldi do from time to time have some superb whiskies, their older whisky expressions are often a fraction of the price of a name brand. They make great everyday whiskies, and from time to time they release something pretty special (usually around Christmas). I'm not ashamed to have more than a few in my collection.
<p>Supermarket <em>award winning whiskies</em> are often solid enough when compared purely on price. Don&rsquo;t believe the headlines though, if you&rsquo;re drinking a supermarket bottle the only person who really thinks it&rsquo;s the best whisky in the world is the journalist. Maybe&hellip;.</p>
